Using geo tagged tweet data to calculate several Hive queries



# Find hour of the day that generated most number of tweets on March 6, 2010

select hour(ts) as hour_of_day, count(*) tweet_count
from twitter.full_text_ts
where to_date(ts) = '2010-03-06'
group by hour(ts)
order by tweet_count desc;
limit 1;





# Find the most mobile tweeter

## User who tweeted from most distinct location (lat-lon)

select id, count(distinct t.lat_lon) as dist_loc
from 
  (select id, concat(lat, ',', lon) as lat_lon from twitter.full_text_ts) t
group by id
order by dist_loc desc;
limit 1;






# Find 3 most popular topics (hashtags)

select t.hashtag, count(*) as tweet_count
from 
   (select regexp_extract(lower(tweet), '(.*)#(\\w+)(.*)',2) as hashtag from twitter.full_text_ts) t
group by t.hashtag
order by tweet_count desc
limit 3;


select t.hashtag, count(*) as tweet_count
from

group by t.hashtag
order by tweet_count desc
limit 3;




# Find most frequently mentioned twitter handle @

select t.twitter_handle, count(*) as tweet_count
from 
   (select regexp_extract(lower(tweet), '(.*)@user_(\\S{8})([:| ])(.*)',2) as twitter_handle from twitter.full_text_ts) t
